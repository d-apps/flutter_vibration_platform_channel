# Flutter Vibration Platform Channel 

## Project Overview

This project serves as a study environment and practical laboratory to explore advanced concepts in 
Flutter development. The topics covered include:

### TDD (Test-Driven Development):

Adoption of TDD practices to ensure code quality and reliability. The development process will 
begin with writing tests that define the desired functionality, followed by implementing the code 
to pass those tests.

### Unit and Integration Tests:

Unit tests will be created to validate the business logic 
in isolation, and integration tests will be created to ensure that the different system modules 
function correctly together.

### State Management with BLoC and Cubit Implementation:

Use of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to separate 
business logic from the user interface (UI), creating reactive, testable, and organized applications.

### Clean Architecture:

Application of Clean Architecture principles to build decoupled, modular, scalable, and easily 
maintainable code. The structure will be divided into presentation, domain, and data layers, 
ensuring that dependencies flow towards the center of the application.

### Native Android and iOS Code Access (Platform Channel):

Exploration of communication between Flutter and the native 
platforms (Android and iOS) through Platform Channels. This will allow access to specific APIs and 
resources of each operating system, such as device vibration control, which gives the project its name.
